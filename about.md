I'm currently a Senior Cyber Security Analyst in a SOC. I got into cyber security after a friend got me to watch Mr. Robot back in 2016. I realized I had to gain this superpower of hacking for myself.

I'm also an enthusiast, admirer, and hobbyist of the 80's and 90's OG cypherpunks and the resulting hacker/anti-surveillance culture of the past two decades.
So, no surprise -- I'm also into the cryptographic currency revolution (Bitcoin + Monero, ZCash, Wownero, and all the other privacy coins). So if you want to contribute to Ben's Pizza Fund, please don't be shy:

But most importantly, I'm a husband, father, son, brother, and Christian member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints.
