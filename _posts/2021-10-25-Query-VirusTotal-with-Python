title: Query VirusTotal with Python
---

## Problem
You are tired of manually querying IOCs in VirusTotal in the browser and you want to automate it. Luckily for you (unfortunately, not me at the moment), your enterprise environment allows creation/execution of self-made scripts.

## Solution
Visit my unfinished cli python script here: https://github.com/ben-jiles/VT-Inquirer
It can query basic malicious score info on IP addresses at the moment, but I am building it out to encompass everything.

This is just a starting block.
